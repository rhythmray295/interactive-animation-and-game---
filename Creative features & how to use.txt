How to launch

First and foremost, you must need unity, or maybe not as its just a game export. I believe you have it based on the shear amount of unity projects and this being an animation class. 
You just need to have unity installed and nothing else. Simply double-click on CS408_Assignment2_Part1 application file and the assignment will open up as a video game setting

As for the submission itself, 3 objects follow 3 different types of required animations. While the interactable cube can be moved in any direction, upto you

Controlls
Press WASD to move the cube
Use Q and E to change gravitational pull for cube
Press Alt + f4 to quit the application.
I am not sure if there would be an windows warning, I do not think so if Unity is installed

*****Creative Feature******
1. The program works as a video game, very lazy video game.
2. Gravity is included and plays a part in it
3. All 3 other objects are interactable, means you can hit them
4. Try hitting the big coin with the cube, it will fall, giving the low amount of balance it has.

p.s. Only 1 model has the creator mentioned, and all pieces are royality free.

Also, I could not include the original edit/build files as the files exceed the URcourses limit significantly
However, you can find them in github in the following link

*****Source Code******  //Notice: This work needs very little coding as engine is already pre-made a lot of components

//in C#

using UnityEngine;

public class Movement : MonoBehaviour { 
    public Rigidbody rb;


    // Update is called once per frame
    void FixedUpdate()
    {
        rb.AddForce(0, 450 * Time.deltaTime, 0);

        if(Input.GetKey("d"))
        {
            rb.AddForce(100 * Time.deltaTime, 0, 0);
        }
        if (Input.GetKey("a"))
        {
            rb.AddForce(-100 * Time.deltaTime, 0, 0);
        }
        if (Input.GetKey("q"))
        {
            rb.AddForce(0, 100 * Time.deltaTime, 0);
        }
        if (Input.GetKey("e"))
        {
            rb.AddForce(0, -100 * Time.deltaTime, 0);
        }
        if (Input.GetKey("w"))
        {
            rb.AddForce(0, 0, 100 * Time.deltaTime);
        }
        if (Input.GetKey("s"))
        {
            rb.AddForce(0, 0, -100 * Time.deltaTime);
        }

    }
}
